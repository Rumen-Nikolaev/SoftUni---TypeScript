# TypeScript Single Page Application (SPA) Workshop

This workshop involves creating a simple SPA using TypeScript. The goal is to practice TypeScript, especially with modules, and to interact with a public API. Everything should be written with TypeScript, **no JavaScript files allowed**.

## Features

- **Use Webpack Skeleton**: Use the Webpack skeleton we created during the lectures.
- **Modules & TypeScript**: All code should be modular and written in TypeScript files only.
- **API Interaction**: Interact with the [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/) API for CRUD operations.
- **Typification**: Focus on adding as much type information as possible, especially for API data. Push your understanding of TypeScript to improve through practice.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities using the API.

## Requirements

- **PostsService**: Create a `PostsService` class to handle CRUD operations for posts.
- **UsersService**: Create a `UsersService` class to handle CRUD operations for users.
- **Post Listing**: Allow users to list posts by a specific user.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: You can render the data however you prefer. Itâ€™s not essential for this exercise.
- **Plain Styling**: Styling is not important. The focus is on TypeScript.

## Bonuses

- **HtmlRenderer Class**: Create an `HtmlRenderer` class to dynamically render content in the app.
- **Decorators**: Add some decorators (e.g., for validation, logging, etc.).
- **Generics**: Use generics to demonstrate your understanding.
- **Inheritance**: Show how inheritance can be used in your code.
- **Show Your Skills**: Apply everything you've learned in TypeScript!

## Notes

- **Fake CRUD**: CRUD operations with the API are faked, which is fine for this workshop. You can also use your own server if you prefer.
- **The main objective**: This workshop is all about practicing interaction with APIs using TypeScript.
