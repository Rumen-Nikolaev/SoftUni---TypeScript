# Exercises: Introduction to TypeScript

## Calculate Rectangle Area
Write a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. You will be given two integers representing the length and width of the rectangle. Calculate and print the area of the rectangle.

## Largest Number
Write a function that takes three number arguments as input and finds the largest of them. Print the following text on the console: `The largest number is {number}.`.

## Sum of Numbers Nâ€¦M
Write a function that takes two integer numbers N and M as input and prints the sum of all numbers from N to M. The input comes as two string elements that need to be parsed as numbers. The output should print the sum.

## Day of Week
Write a function that prints a number between 1 and 7 when a day of the week is passed to it as a string, and an error message if the string is not recognized.

## Math Operations
Write a function that takes two numbers and a string as input. The string may be one of the following: '+', '-', '*', '/', '%', '**'. Print the result of the mathematical operation between both numbers and the operator you receive as a string.

## Even Position Element
Write a function that finds the elements at even positions in an array. The input comes as an array of string elements. The output is printed on the console. Collect all elements in a string, separated by space.

## Bigger Half
You are given an array of numbers. Write a function that sorts the array in ascending order and returns a new array containing only the second half of the input. If there is an odd number of elements in the input, always take the bigger half.

## Cats
Write a function that receives an array of strings in the format '{cat name} {age}'. Create a `Cat` class that takes the name and age as arguments and has a method named `meow` that will print "{cat name}, age {age} says Meow" on the console.

## Employees
Create a list of employees and their personal numbers. You will receive an array of strings, where each string is an employee's name. Assign each employee a personal number based on the length of their name (whitespace included). Print all employees in the following format: "Name: {employeeName} -- Personal Number: {personalNum}".

## Aggregate Elements
Write a program that performs different operations on an array of elements. Implement the following operations:
- **Sum(ai)**: Calculates the sum of all elements from the input array.
- **Sum(1/ai)**: Calculates the sum of the inverse values (1/ai) of all elements from the array.
- **Concat(ai)**: Concatenates the string representations of all elements from the array.

The output should be printed on the console on a new line for each of the operations.
