# Employees
Create a list of employees and their personal numbers. You will receive an array of strings, where each string is an employee's name. Assign each employee a personal number based on the length of their name (whitespace included). Print all employees in the following format: "Name: {employeeName} -- Personal Number: {personalNum}".
